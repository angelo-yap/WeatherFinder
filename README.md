To use the Weather Finder, enter the name of a city in Canada or click one of the "Top 10 Cities" listed on the side bar to the right. If a city outside of Canada is entered in the search bar, there will be an alert notifying there are no results or a similarly named city in Canada will be displayed (e.g. "London", which will display London, Ontario. Differing from the London on the Top 10 Cities list). The Weather Finder uses a geocoding and forecast API provided by Open-Meteo.
